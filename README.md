# Data Insights on Fetch’s Growth

Hello Stakeholder,

I wanted to share some key findings from my analysis of Fetch’s transactional and user data.

Key Data Quality Issues  
- **Missing & Duplicate Data**: A significant portion of transactions data is missing product and user information. This means my insights represent only a fraction of the full dataset, affecting the accuracy of the trends.  
- **Historical Data Limitations**: The transactions table is limited to a few months in 2024. Additional details like **total receipt volume, total amount spent, and long-term user retention** over several years may provide a clearer view of Fetch’s growth.  

Growth Insights (Based on "Fractional" Data)  
- Fetch experienced **strong growth** from **2015-2022**, reaching **28k unique users** with **40% YoY growth** in 2022.  
- However, **2023 and 2024 show a decline** (-42% and -25%, respectively). This signals a potential drop in user acquisition or retention, which warrants further investigation.  

Request for Action  
To improve data accuracy and unlock deeper insights, I’d appreciate help with the following:  

✅ **Can we confirm whether we have access to the full dataset or just a sample?** If only a sample, how representative is it?  
✅ **Do we have any additional context on why user growth declined in 2023-2024?** Could external factors like **management changes** or **campaign shifts** be contributing to this decline?  

Let me know if you’d like to discuss further! Happy to refine the analysis based on additional input.  

Best, 
Rikesh
